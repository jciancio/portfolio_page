Hi, my name is Joseph Ciancio. I'm a budding software developer looking to expand my skills and grow my network.

Turning ideas into reality is my passion. That's why I majored in Entrepreneurship at the University of Miami's School of Business.

Not only do I work had, but I'm also passionate about what I do. 11+ years experience in Martial Arts has to taught me to never give up!
